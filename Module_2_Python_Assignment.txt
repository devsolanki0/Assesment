Module 2: Introduction to Python

Theoretical Assignments:

1. Explain Python’s Role in Data Science

2. Presentation: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python

Practical Tasks:

Task 1: Python Fundamentals

1. Write a Python program to sum the first n positive integers.

2. Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.

3. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.

4. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

5. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

6. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string. If 'not' follows 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.

7. Program to find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Example: GCD of 20 and 28 is 4; GCD of 98 and 56 is 14.

8. Write a Python program to check whether a list contains a sublist.

9. Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list.

10. Write a Python program to get unique values from a list.

11. Write a Python program to unzip a list of tuples into individual lists.

12. Write a Python program to convert a list of tuples into a dictionary.

13. Write a Python program to sort a dictionary (ascending/descending) by value.

14. Write a Python program to find the highest 3 values in a dictionary.

15. Given a number n, write a Python program to make and print the list of Fibonacci series up to n.
Input: n = 7
Hint: First 7 numbers in the series
Expected Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

16. Counting the frequencies in a list using a dictionary in Python.
Input: [1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Expected Output: 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 2

17. Write a Python program using a function to find the sum of odd and even series.
Odd series: 1^2 / 1! + 3^2 / 3! + 5^2 / 5! + … up to n
Even series: 2^2 / 2! + 4^2 / 4! + 6^2 / 6! + … up to n

18. Python Program to Find Factorial of Number Using Recursion

19. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

20. Mini Project: Password Generator
Problem Statement: Make a program to generate a strong password using input given by the user.
To generate a password, randomly take some words from the user input and then include numbers, special characters, and capital letters to generate the password.
Also, ensure that password length is more than 8 characters.
Note: Include exception handling wherever required.
Also, make a ‘User’ class and store the details like user ID, name, and password of each user as a tuple.
